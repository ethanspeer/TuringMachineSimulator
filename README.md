# TuringMachineSimulator
A java program which simulates the computational trace of a Turing machine.

INPUT: This program takes a file name as a command line argument and simulates a Turing Machine based on specifically formatted tuples.

First build the file:
javac MyTMSimulator.java
Then run the file:
java MyTMSimulator <File Name>
  
Then type a string of characters, and the simulator will execute based on the turing machine specified in the file.
  
OUTPUT: The program prints the computational trace based on the input file for the turing machine and prints either accept or reject.
